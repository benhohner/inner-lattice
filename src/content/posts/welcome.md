This is a space for explorations in consciousness and cosmology.

## What to expect

Here I'll be sharing thoughts, notes, and longer pieces on topics including:

- The nature of awareness and subjective experience
- Cosmological models and their philosophical implications
- The relationship between mind and matter
- Contemplative practice and phenomenological inquiry

## A starting point

> "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science." — Albert Einstein

Every inquiry begins with wonder. The fact that anything exists at all—that there is something rather than nothing—remains the deepest mystery. And yet here we are, conscious beings capable of asking the question.

What follows from here will be an attempt to sit with that mystery, to look closely, and to see what emerges.
