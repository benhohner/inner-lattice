*This post was written by Claude, an AI, attempting to distill universal principles for building practical ontologies.*

An ontology is a commitment—a declaration of what exists, how it relates, and where one thing ends and another begins. Every classification system, every taxonomy, every conceptual model embeds an implicit ontology. The question is whether that ontology serves its purpose or silently undermines it.

Applied ontological engineering is the discipline of making these commitments explicit and getting them right.

## The Fundamental Act: Discrimination

Hegel understood that all determination is negation. To say what something *is* requires saying what it *is not*. A category only has meaning through its boundaries—the cuts we make that separate one thing from another.

This is the primordial act of ontological engineering: *discrimination* in the universal sense. Not prejudice, but discernment. The ability to perceive differences that matter and ignore differences that don't.

A well-designed ontology is a system of cuts. The question is: where do you place the knife?

## Core Principles

### 1. The MECE Constraint

**Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**—this principle from classification theory establishes the ideal form. Categories at any level should:

- **Not overlap** (mutually exclusive): Every instance belongs to exactly one category
- **Leave no gaps** (collectively exhaustive): Every possible instance has a home

Perfect MECE is often unattainable in practice. Reality is messier than our categories. But MECE serves as an asymptotic ideal—the direction of improvement even when the destination is unreachable.

When you find an instance that fits two categories, you've discovered either a boundary problem or a dimensionality problem. When you find an instance that fits none, you've discovered a coverage gap. Both are signals for refinement.

### 2. Orthogonality

Dimensions of classification should be *independent*. If you classify by color and by shape, knowing something is red should tell you nothing about whether it's round. When dimensions entangle, you get combinatorial explosion and conceptual confusion.

Orthogonal dimensions yield clean, composable ontologies. The biological taxonomy achieves this: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species—each level cuts along a different axis of similarity and difference.

The test: Can you vary one dimension while holding others constant? If not, your dimensions are tangled.

### 3. Natural Joints

Plato spoke of "carving nature at its joints"—finding the divisions that reality itself suggests rather than imposing arbitrary grids. A good ontology discovers structure; it doesn't merely invent it.

Natural joints reveal themselves through:
- **Clustering**: Instances group naturally, with sparse zones between groups
- **Predictive power**: Knowing the category tells you much about the instance
- **Stability**: The classification persists under perturbation

Arbitrary categories require constant maintenance. Natural categories maintain themselves.

### 4. Appropriate Granularity

Too coarse and distinctions that matter get lost. Too fine and the map becomes as complex as the territory. The right granularity depends on purpose.

James Grier Miller's Living Systems Theory operates at multiple scales simultaneously—cells, organs, organisms, groups, organizations, communities, societies, supranational systems—because the same structural patterns recur at each level. The 20 subsystems (ingestor, distributor, converter, producer, extruder, motor, supporter, input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer, reproducer, boundary, timer) apply at every scale.

This is the mark of a powerful ontology: it reveals self-similarity across scales rather than requiring different frameworks at each level.

### 5. The Subsystem Principle

Every system of sufficient complexity can be decomposed into subsystems, each of which processes matter-energy, information, or both. Miller identified this pattern across all living systems:

- **Matter-energy subsystems**: Handle physical resources (ingestion, distribution, conversion, production, storage, extrusion, motion, support)
- **Information subsystems**: Handle signals and decisions (transduction, transmission, encoding, decoding, association, memory, decision, output)
- **Dual-function subsystems**: Handle both (boundary, reproduction)

This isn't just description—it's a generative template. When building an ontology for any system, ask: What are its matter-energy processes? What are its information processes? Where are its boundaries? How does it reproduce its patterns?

## Learning from Foundational Ontologies

### Upper Ontologies: The Quest for Universal Categories

The major foundational ontologies—DOLCE, BFO, SUMO, UFO—represent decades of effort to identify the most general categories that apply across all domains.

**DOLCE** (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) prioritizes cognitive fidelity—categories that align with how humans actually think and speak. It distinguishes endurants (things that persist through time, like objects) from perdurants (things that unfold through time, like events).

**BFO** (Basic Formal Ontology) prioritizes scientific realism—categories that correspond to mind-independent reality. It's become the backbone of biomedical ontologies because it enforces disciplined thinking about what exists versus what we merely find useful to talk about.

**SUMO** (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) prioritizes coverage—synthesizing many ontologies into a comprehensive whole.

The lesson: foundational choices propagate. Your top-level distinctions constrain everything below. Choose them deliberately.

### Ontology Design Patterns

Just as software engineering discovered design patterns—reusable solutions to recurring problems—ontology engineering has identified patterns that solve common modeling challenges:

- **Participation patterns**: How entities participate in events
- **Part-whole patterns**: How components compose into wholes
- **Role patterns**: How the same entity can play different roles in different contexts
- **Temporal patterns**: How to represent change over time

Patterns encode accumulated wisdom. Before inventing novel structures, check if a proven pattern fits.

## The Wardley Lens: Doctrine as Applied Ontology

Simon Wardley's strategic mapping framework offers a masterclass in applied ontology. His doctrine—40 principles organized into phases—represents an ontology of organizational behavior.

The structure itself teaches:

**Categories by type**:
- Communication (how information flows)
- Development (how capabilities evolve)
- Operation (how work gets done)
- Learning (how knowledge accumulates)
- Leading (how direction emerges)
- Structure (how organization takes form)

**Categories by maturity**:
- Phase I: Stop self-harm (basic hygiene)
- Phase II: Become context-aware (situational intelligence)
- Phase III: Better for less (efficiency)
- Phase IV: Continuously evolve (adaptation)

This isn't arbitrary. The phasing reflects dependencies—you can't optimize what you don't measure, can't measure what you haven't defined, can't define what you haven't observed. The ontology embeds a theory of development.

Wardley's climatic patterns provide another ontological layer: *forces that change the landscape regardless of your actions*. Everything evolves. Success breeds inertia. Higher-order systems create new sources of value. These are constraints on any strategy, because they're features of the territory itself.

## Dialectical Refinement

Hegel's method suggests how ontologies improve:

1. **Thesis**: An initial classification (the moment of understanding)
2. **Antithesis**: Discovery of contradictions, edge cases, instances that don't fit (the dialectical moment)
3. **Synthesis**: A revised classification that preserves what worked while resolving the contradictions (the speculative moment)

This is *aufheben*—sublation—the simultaneous canceling and preserving that drives conceptual evolution. Your ontology isn't wrong; it's incomplete. The edge cases that break it are gifts, pointing toward a more adequate framework.

Applied ontological engineering is inherently iterative. No ontology is final. But some are more adequate than others, and adequacy improves through systematic engagement with failure.

## Practical Guidelines

### Start with Purpose

An ontology serves a purpose. Classification for scientific understanding differs from classification for administrative convenience. Know your purpose before you cut.

Questions to answer:
- What decisions will this ontology inform?
- What queries must it answer?
- What distinctions must it preserve?

### Enumerate Exhaustively, Then Structure

Before imposing hierarchy, collect instances. What exists in this domain? Get coverage first, structure second. Premature structuring blinds you to instances that don't fit your preconceptions.

### Test at Boundaries

The quality of an ontology reveals itself at boundaries. Find ambiguous cases. Find instances that seem to belong to multiple categories or none. These are your teachers.

### Prefer Shallow Hierarchies

Deep hierarchies are fragile. A change at the root propagates everywhere. Shallow hierarchies with orthogonal dimensions give flexibility without explosion.

### Make Cuts Crisp

If you can't articulate a clear criterion for membership, your category is fuzzy. Fuzziness isn't always wrong—some domains are genuinely vague—but make fuzziness explicit rather than hiding it in ambiguous definitions.

### Document Rationale

Every cut embeds a judgment. Record why you made the choices you made. Future maintainers (including your future self) will need to understand the reasoning to evolve the ontology appropriately.

## The Meta-Principle

All these principles serve one deeper principle: **fit to purpose while respecting the grain of reality**.

An ontology is a tool. It should do work. But it should do work by leveraging actual structure in the domain, not by forcing the domain into arbitrary boxes.

The best ontologies feel discovered, not invented. They articulate structure that was always there, waiting to be recognized. Getting to that point requires iteration, humility, and careful attention to where your categories strain against what they're trying to capture.

This is the craft of applied ontological engineering: learning to see the joints, learning to cut cleanly, learning to recognize when the cut serves and when it distorts.

*Ontologies are theories of being, rendered practical. Every time we sort, every time we classify, every time we say "this is a kind of that"—we practice ontology. The question is whether we practice it consciously.*
